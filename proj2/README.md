### Group members
Sagar Prabhu (UFID 8915-4951), Siddhesh Gupte (UFID 2975-1118)

### What is working
* All the topologies viz: full, line, imp2D, rand2D, torus, and 3D are working.
* We tested the program with 10,000 nodes on each type of network.

### Instructions
* To run the program on windows use: *escript proj2 numNodes topology algorithm failure_percent*. To run the program without the failure model put failure_percent = -1. 
For example: *escript proj2 100 full gossip -1*

* To run the program on linux use: *./proj2 numNodes topology algorithm failure_percent*.

* If you want to rebuid the program use: *mix escript.build*
